<div class="ql-editor" data-gramm="false" contenteditable="true"><p>The term digital twin was originally developed to improve manufacturing and industrial processes [1]. Digital twins were subsequently defined as digital replications of physical entities that enable data to be seamlessly transmitted contents from physical to virtual worlds. Digital twins facilitate the means to monitor, understand and optimize the functions of all physical entities and provide people continuous feedback to improve quality of life and well-being [2]. Digital twin is at the vanguard of the Industry 4.0 revolution enabled through advanced data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. IoT has increased the volume of many heterogeneous usable data from manufacturing, healthcare and smart city applications [3]. The IoT environment provides an important resource for predictive main<span class="highlight">tenance and er</span>ror detection, in particular for the future health of manufacturing processes and smart city developments, while also aiding in fault detection and traffic management in a next smart city. Since a perfect integration between IoT and data analysis will be necessary in the near future, this important need will be possible thanks to the creation of a connection between physical and virtual twins. A digital twin environment allows smart cities for quick analysis and, using 5G network, real-time decisions can be made through an accurate analysis.</p></div><div class="ql-clipboard" contenteditable="true" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="ql-tooltip ql-hidden"><a class="ql-preview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="about:blank"></a><input type="text" data-formula="e=mc^2" data-link="https://quilljs.com" data-video="Embed URL"><a class="ql-action"></a><a class="ql-remove"></a></div>
